        I've been interested in computers and software from a young age and
        decided early on to persue a career in tech. I'm always striving to
        learn new skills and be involved with tech that interests me.

        Aside from that, I also love to Fence 🤺, play guitar 🎸, and do video
        editing projects 🎞️.
